# Predicting outcome of movement trajectories using RNN

The project is contained in the Jupyter notebook.

 - Participants reached from a start circle to one of two targets. Thus, there were three possible outcomes of the trajectories: Left target reach, Right target reach, Not reached target in time.
 - The RNN was trained to predict the outcome of the trajectory given a 100 ms trajectory sample (x coordinates, y coordinates, x velocities, y velocities and time in trial).
